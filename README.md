# Vrinda-sales-performance-dashboard
This project focuses on the sales data analysis for Vrinda Store, where I developed an interactive dashboard using Google Sheets to provide insights into performance across multiple e-commerce platforms. The dataset contains over 31,000 rows of sales records, offering a comprehensive view of the business's sales trends and patterns.
## Project Objective:
To create an Annual Sales Report for Vrinda Store for FY 2022, providing insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. This analysis will guide strategic planning and growth initiatives for the next financial year.
