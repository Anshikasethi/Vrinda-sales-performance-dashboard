# Vrinda-sales-performance-dashboard
This project focuses on the sales data analysis for Vrinda Store, where I developed an interactive dashboard using Google Sheets to provide insights into performance across multiple e-commerce platforms. The dataset contains over 31,000 rows of sales records, offering a comprehensive view of the business's sales trends and patterns.
